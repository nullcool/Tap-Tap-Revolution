## Front End Engineering

  This is a Javascript production of a 2007 phone game. The orbs will come down
  the screen to the beat of the song and it is the job of the user to use the left,
  down, and right arrow keys to stop the ball before it gets off the screen. Press
  respective key for the left, center, and right columns.

  I utilized HTML5 to render the graphics to the screen. The colored orbs follow
  the path using custom equations to determine the trajectory along with giving them
  a 3D effect.
